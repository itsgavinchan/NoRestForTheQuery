No Rest For the Query
===============

### Game Description
No Rest For The Query is a 2D action side-scroller, developed by a two-person team, to mimic (or mock) the life of a college student via action-based glory. The player plays as a black figure with particular status bars, including health and fatigue. They will combat homework assignments with pencils, encounter professors that throw dry erase markers toward an 'inattentive' student, and conquer bosses (otherwise known as exams). With four stages and a merchant system to restock on supplies and prepare for the next school year, the goal is to graduate on time.
